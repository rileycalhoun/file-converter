# A File Converter, built with Rust
## UNSTABLE BRANCH
Yes, this is the master branch. Yes, it is unstable. I'm not entirely sure how well the Webhooks work yet; I will fix bugs as I encounter them myself.
If you use this and find a bug please create an issue.

## Instructions
You need a postgres database and a CloudConvert API key to run this locally.
I'll probably make better documentation once the file converter is almost done.

## IN TESTING
* CloudConvert webhooks to ensure the website doesn't time out when you are converting a large file.

## TODO
* Add a file lookup (with password)
* Allow multiple files to be converted at once
* Create better documentation
