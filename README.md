# A File Converter, built with Rust
## UNSTABLE BRANCH
See [master](https://github.com/rileycalhoun/file-converter/tree/master) branch

## Instructions
You need a postgres database and a CloudConvert API key to run this locally.
I'll probably make better documentation once the file converter is almost done.

## TODO
* Add webhook support to ensure a timeout doesn't occur (in progress)
* Add a file lookup (with password)
* Allow multiple files to be converted at once
